# Blackjack project

### Description
This application allows a single user to play Blackjack with an automated dealer.
It is an exercise is Object Oriented Programming, utilizing appropriate project design.
It makes use of the pillars of OOP; abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation.

### Lessons Learned
- Extra practice with comparators. It wasn't strictly necessary to implement one but I wanted the extra practice as it's one of my weaker points, and it allowed for the use of a switch over an if else statement when determining the winner
- Encapsulation is good and probably important. Too many layers could get overwhelming incredibly quickly. Casting and calling methods on methods on methods really starts to take its toll on readability. I offset this as much as I could but still feel less confident this week than past weeks.
- Refactoring is also very important. Disregard all that stuff ^ my code is amazing. I made a mess while just worrying about the functionality but I think I was able to clean it up pretty well and I feel a lot better about it now.

### Technologies Used
- Git 
- Java
