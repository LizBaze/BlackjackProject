# Blackjack project

### Description
This application allows a single user to play Blackjack with an automated dealer.
It is an exercise is Object Oriented Programming, utilizing appropriate project design.
It makes use of the pillars of OOP; abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation.

### Lessons Learned
- Extra practice with comparators. It wasn't strictly necessary to implement one but I wanted the extra practice as it's one of my weaker points, and it allowed for the use of a switch over an if else statement when determining the winner
- Encapsulation good? Too many layers could get overwhelming incredibly quickly. The amount of casting I had to do has me wondering whether or not my class structure is ideal.
